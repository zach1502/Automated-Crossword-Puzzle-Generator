# IMPORTANT
This will likely not work on your machine unless you also use the Brave Browser. If you don't, I recommend modifying the code in utils/collect_words.py, line 57 and change the file path to where your Chromium browser is located.

# How to Run
## Step 1
Install dependencies. It's a lot
PIL (Python image library) `pip install Pillow`
MatPlotLib `pip install matplotlib`
Selenium `pip install selenium`
Numpy `pip install numpy`
Requests `pip install requests`
BeautifulSoup `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## Step 2
Run unit_tests.py and see if everything works.

Then run crossword_gen.py, modify line 40 if you would like more pages.
by default, it only makes 3.
